Music Playlist Management System (C++)
This project is a console-based Music Playlist Management System developed in C++. It uses fundamental data structures (linked lists) to manage a playlist of songs with operations like adding, deleting, saving, and displaying songs. The application mimics basic functionality of a media playlist manager.

 Features / Modules Covered:
 Add Song: Allows users to input song name, artist, and duration and appends it to the playlist.

 Delete Song: Removes a song from the playlist based on the song name.

 Save Playlist to File: Saves the current playlist to a .txt file in a formatted table.

 Display Playlist: Displays all songs in the current playlist with their details.

 Exit Option: Allows the user to gracefully exit the application.

Concepts & Topics Used:
C++ Structs and Classes

Singly Linked List (Dynamic Data Structure)

Pointers and Memory Management

File Handling using fstream

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles

Menu-Driven Interface using Switch Statements

User Input with cin and getline

 File Structure:
main.cpp – Contains the entire source code.

playlist.txt – Output file where saved playlist gets written.
